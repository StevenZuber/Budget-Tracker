Budget Tracker

Week 13 project at Skill Distillery

Overview: 

This is a simple budget tracking app that allows the user to enter their monthly
 
expenses and delete or edit existing ones. At the bottom of the table is a total
 
of the user's monthly expenses. 

Technologies: 

The app is built on top of a mysql database, built in mysql workbench. 
The database is used in Java JPA and MVC, where object entities are mapped 
to mysql table elements. The user interface was built almost entirely in 
JavaScript (implementing the JQuery library), with some css for styling.  

Future Goals: 

Once we learn how to do secure user logins, I'd like to implement a feature 
where the user can input their annual income and display the total 
percentage of their income they spend on the expenses in the table. User 
logins will also allow the app to functional for individual users, 
instead of every user seeing the same data. 

Stumbling Blocks:

I was able to practice more with utilizing functions and closures in JS, as 
well as get some more practice with JQuery. The major obstacle that I kept 
tripping over was being mindful of the methods that come along with JQuery and
utilizing them.
